      <p>Hi. My name is Trevor. Welcome.</p>
      <p>
        Putting emojis on your website is very ~cool~ these days, from what I
        understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't really put a whole lot of information out into the world, but
        this is where I share things that I'm working on, things I like, things
        I'm interested in, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes I make things that are <Link to="/blue">blue</Link>. Sometimes
        I make <Link to="/diypostmodern">shapes</Link>. Usually I'm making{' '}
        <Link to="/projects">web applications</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>Please stick around. I hope you enjoy. It's good to have you.</p>
